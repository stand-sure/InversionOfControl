# InversionOfControl

This is intended as a teaching example for those trying to understand how *dependency injection* or __DI__ (a.k.a. *inversion of control* __IoC__) works at a basic level.

It is __NOT__ intended to be used in production.  There are plenty of well-developed free DI/IoC packages available for the .NET framework.
